# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using PyTorch Lightning. The system is trained on a dataset that can be downloaded as a zip file from a webpage.

## Dataset

To download the dataset, follow these steps:

1. Go to [webpage URL].
2. Click on the "Download" button to download the dataset as a zip file.
3. Extract the contents of the zip file into the `data` directory.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
movie-recommendation-system
├── data
│   └── README.md  # Instructions to download dataset as zip from webpage
├── src
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── model.py  # PyTorch Lightning model
│   └── train.py  # Training script
├── tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_model.py
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       ├── python-app.yml  # GitHub Actions for tests
│       └── lint.yml  # GitHub Actions for linting
├── pyproject.toml  # Poetry dependency file
├── poetry.lock
└── README.md
```

- `data/README.md`: This file contains instructions on how to download the dataset as a zip file from a webpage.

- `src/__init__.py`: This file is an empty Python file that marks the `src` directory as a Python package.

- `src/model.py`: This file contains the PyTorch Lightning model for the movie recommendation system. It likely exports a class or functions related to the model architecture and training.

- `src/train.py`: This file is the training script for the movie recommendation system. It likely imports the model from `model.py` and contains code for training the model using the downloaded dataset.

- `tests/__init__.py`: This file is an empty Python file that marks the `tests` directory as a Python package.

- `tests/test_model.py`: This file contains unit tests for the movie recommendation system. It likely imports the model from `src/model.py` and tests its functionality.

- `.github/workflows/python-app.yml`: This file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file for running tests on the project. It likely specifies the steps to set up the Python environment, install dependencies, and run the tests.

- `.github/workflows/lint.yml`: This file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file for linting the project. It likely specifies the steps to set up the Python environment, install linting tools, and run the linting checks.

- `pyproject.toml`: This file is the Poetry dependency file. It lists the project dependencies and their versions.

- `poetry.lock`: This file is automatically generated by Poetry and contains the resolved versions of the project dependencies.

## Usage

To train the movie recommendation system, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset as a zip file from [webpage URL].
2. Extract the contents of the zip file into the `data` directory.
3. Install the project dependencies using Poetry: `poetry install`.
4. Run the training script: `python src/train.py`.
